# Data

Store data created/collated for the project in these folders.

In the README files, include locations of any files or resources stored elsewhere (e.g. OneDrive) - possibly as hyperlinks. Hyperlinks can be created with square brackets around words you want to become the [link](followed by the link itself in round brackets).

NB. Any files in the data folders other than `README.md` files **will not be tracked by git**. If you do want a data file to be included in the GitHub repository, you need to go to the `.gitignore` file.


Tips:

* Use relative file paths
* Avoid spaces in file names, use underscores instead
* It is better to use one single source of data that has the same structure as the final folder. So it gets easier to link the scripts and results to the data.
* Avoid upload binary data (e.g.*.rds) as GitHub track every change and it would generate too much work for GitHub.
