# ⚡Workflow for estimating energetics of North Atlantic seabirds ⚡

This repository contains the workflow needed to calculate and map estimates of non-breeding season energy expenditure for six species of pelagic seabirds in the North Atlantic from immersion and positional (GLS) data collected via the SEATRACK program (https://seatrack.net/). It uses a probabilistic approach where uncertainty is included where possible and propagated through the workflow to the final results. 

This workflow stems from another project (SeabirdEnergetics) which was developed locally in R and is now being properly seperated from this initial work. 

## Simple Schematic of workflow

Cirles 1 & 2 form the basis for the work conducted in a paper that is in review (details to follow).

Circle 3 is under construction. 

## Pre-requisites 

Access to a high-performance computing cluster is required. This workflow has been built to run on SAGA (https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/saga.html) but can be modified to run on other hpc systems, or eventually on a local machine.
