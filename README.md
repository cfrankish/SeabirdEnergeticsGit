# ⚡Workflow for estimating energetics of North Atlantic seabirds ⚡

This repository contains the workflow needed to calculate and map estimates of non-breeding season energy expenditure for six species of pelagic seabirds in the North Atlantic from immersion and positional (GLS) data collected via the SEATRACK program (https://seatrack.net/). It uses a probabilistic approach where uncertainty is included where possible and propagated through the workflow to the final results.

## Pre-requisites 

Access to a high-performance computing cluster is required. This workflow has been built to run on SAGA (https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/saga.html) but can be modified to run on other hpc systems, or eventually on a local machine.
